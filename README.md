# Time-Series-Data-Analysis

This notebook provides an exploratory analysis of a time-series data i.e. Rossmann store sales data from 2013 until July 2015.

In general, the analysis provides some insights on some of the factors that affect the sales performance, stores that shows increases in yearly sales' performances, store that has highest sales/customer ratio and etc.

We also explore the time-series approach of forecasting such dataset. The analysis look at time series concepts of stationarity, trend and seasonality, and also the ACF and PACF plots.

We first uses the Holts-Winter model to make the sales forecast. We then uses the model from Prophet API and compared their performances based on the MAE and RMSE values.
